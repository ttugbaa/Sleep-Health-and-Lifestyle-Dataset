# Sleep-Health-and-Lifestyle-Dataset
The dataset includes details such as gender, age, occupation, sleep duration, sleep quality, physical activity level, stress levels, BMI category, blood pressure, heart rate, daily steps, and the presence or absence of sleep disorders.

To gain deeper insights into this data, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was conducted. This process began by understanding the structure and characteristics of the dataset, including the data types and distributions of the various features. Any missing values were then identified and appropriately handled to ensure the data were clean and ready for further analysis.

Next, descriptive statistics were generated to summarize the dataset and uncover relationships between the different variables. This involved calculating measures of central tendency, dispersion, and exploring the correlations between the features. Visualizations were also created to provide a more intuitive understanding of the data, allowing for the identification of patterns, trends, and potential outliers.

Building upon the insights gained from the EDA, a classification model was developed to predict the presence or absence of sleep disorders based on the available features.
